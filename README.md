# OfflineGames
This repo contains no software, just information so that you can play "your" purchased errr rented games offline "The way it's meant to be played" since the company you bought them from doesn't care since they already have your money and they know their "consumers" will just roll over and take it as well as being toxic to their fellow "consumers".

DO NOT ASK WHERE TO ACQUIRE SOFTWARE TO BYPASS THESE UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS

DO NOT ASK WHERE TO ACQUIRE CRACKED VERSIONS OF GAMES

Google is your friend....well not really but you know what I mean.
