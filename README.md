Documentation on methods for playing games without unecessary restrictions so you can play "your" purchased games

This project contains no software, just information so that you can play "your" purchased errr rented games since the company you bought them from doesn't care since they already have your money.

DO NOT ASK FOR WHERE TO ACQUIRE SOFTWARE TO BYPASS THESE RESTRICTIONS
DO NOT ASK FOR WHERE TO ACQUIRE CRACKED VERSIONS OF GAMES
Google is your friend....well not really but you know what I mean.
