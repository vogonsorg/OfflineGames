# OfflineGames
This repo contains no software, just information so that you can play "your" purchased errr rented games offline "The way it's meant to be played" since the company you bought them from doesn't care since they already have your money and they know their "consumers" will just roll over and take it as well as being toxic to their fellow "consumers".

DO NOT ASK WHERE TO ACQUIRE SOFTWARE TO BYPASS THESE UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS

DO NOT ASK WHERE TO ACQUIRE CRACKED VERSIONS OF GAMES

Google is your friend....well not really but you know what I mean.

Some things on the list may not make sense for why they are on the list, I did not intend on uploading this list until I had things more organized  and cleaned up but Valve accelerated things so here we are. Do not assume that if an OS is listed that it is only compatible with that OS. If GOG games are listed do not assume they have DRM, etc etc.
